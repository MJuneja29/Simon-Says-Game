              - The 'btn' class provides base styling.
              - The 'red' class sets the specific color.
              - The 'id' is used by the JavaScript to identify which button was pressed.
              - Note: Using a 'div' as a button is common for simple projects,
                but for better accessibility, <button> elements are preferred.
